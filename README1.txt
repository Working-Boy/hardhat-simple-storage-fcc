---- TO LIST ALL AVAILABLE ACCOUNTS IN YOUR HARDHAT ENVIRONMENT -----
1. Create a scripts folder inside your project directory:
mkdir scripts
2. Create a new file inside the scripts/ folder. Let's call it accounts.js.
touch scripts/accounts.js
3. Edit the accounts.js file to list the accounts. You can open the file and add the following code:
async function main() {
    const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();

    console.log("Deployer address:", deployer.address);

    const accounts = await ethers.getSigners();
    console.log("All accounts:");
    accounts.forEach((account, index) => {
        console.log(`${index + 1}: ${account.address}`);
    });
}

main()
    .then(() => process.exit(0))
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
4. Run the script to see the accounts:
npx hardhat run scripts/accounts.js

Once done, this script WILL list all the available accounts in your Hardhat environment. Let me know if you need any more help!

NOTE: yarn = npm = npx    SO USE ANYONE YOU FEEL WANT TO.
